*This is a personal blog, implemented to encourage myself to write and reflect on the various messing around with things that I do in the tech space.*

I've been a user of my Gmail account and by extension (& by Google's design) the Google Account Ecosystem since approximately 2007. Very willingly letting them take care of the problem of email and other services for the past 16 years for myself and anyone I could recommend it to (back when people recommended email providers in casual conversation).


Up until recently I've been comfortable to maintain the status quo. But now I am strongly considering (and actively investigating) how to extract myself from utilising Google's services. I'd like to share a few reasons *why* here now, and then (hopefully) future posts will cover the *how*.

### Digital Identity and Trust
Digital identity, A catch-all term for all of your data, accounts and interactions online. A driving thought for me was how do I ensure that my digital identity is *flexible*. I want to be able to use the core functions of the internet, without being tethered to a particular enabling corporation. You might ask, why Gmail for years then? Trust. I placed my data in a service and a company that I, my Dad and my family trusted. Was this misplaced? Perhaps, but in the infancy of widespread email, Gmail was a pure offering.

[Paul Buchheit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Buchheit), the creator of Gmail, said that "Don't be Evil", the company's infamous motto was a jab at other companies at the time, who were exploiting users. Unfortunately, Google has travelled a long way since then, and nowadays they seem more likely to fall in with the crowd that are exploiting, rather than not.

There was no singular moment that broke my trust in Google's system, but I estimate the past few years have been a constant acceleration down the  slide of uncertainty. And I have been increasingly uncertain about ensuring the flexibility and accessibility of digital identity that is tied up in their ecosystem.

 [killedbygoogle.com](https://killedbygoogle.com) is a damming list that demonstrates Google's ruthlessness towards ill-performing products. My personal stand out here was Google Podcasts, an app that I was actively using **the very day** (27/09/2023) they sent me an email announcing they were discontinuing it in favour of Youtube music. 
 
 There are a plethora of other podcast apps out there that I can readily switch to, including many that could import my subscriptions. But the level of trust that I had in Google to enable that service for me, definetly took a blow.
 
I don't expect Google to ever sunset Gmail, but I do believe that it will  get worse as a product, as Google's attention is driven to other sources of revenue.

I want my digital identity to be something that I can control, and not be dictated by an enabling corporation. Or at the very least, be modular in a way that I can respond better to changing services rather than a monolithic beast.

### Luxury Resouces
I once believed that anyone who paid for email was an idiot.
In late 2022, Telstra made all payphones across Australia [free to use](https://www.telstra.com.au/exchange/payphones-free-for-calls-australia) for anyone. I can just as easily walk up to a phonebox and make a call, as I can sign up for a Gmail account.

Yet I haven't used one at all since then and I've only seen two others utilise the new free service.

Why?

The payphones are there, but most people (myself included) pay monthly for a better utility, a mobile phone in our pocket. I still believe that payphones should be there for those who need them, like me back in highschool. Just trying to get a hold of Mum. However, now I've come to recognise the benefit of paying for services like email that have become a fundamental building block for how we interact with the world.

Some #Spoilers for the next *How* post where I hope to go into more detail about what I've been looking at. But one's email address has become a ubiquitous username that is used almost across every surface of their digital identity.


### Privacy
![Spy](/assets/img/posts/spy.webp){: .left w="180" }
The way Google has crept into many aspects of my life has, due to a slow but steady approach taken me by surprise. In what is clearly an effort to gain as much marketable knowledge as possible about their customer base. Although I can't paint them as deceitful, as I was the sucker who signed all the user agreements, and opted to 'sign in with Google' to other services. Despite my regular review of the provided account privacy panel, this doesn't counteract the fact that Google's core business is [advertising](https://about.google/how-our-business-works/). And they are going to use whatever information they can glean to optimise that income. I now feel that action is required to remedy this.

An often rolled out quote when dealing with data privacy:
> If you are not paying for it, you're not the customer; you're the product

 First used prior to the internet boom, however I don't thing it really came into form until the targeted advertising ecosystem took over. To me, this **has** to influence the core values that are in forefront of Google's product designers.
 
I am not a die-hard privacy guru, and my end solution likely won't end up as being perfect in that respect. But I am looking forward to gaining back some ownership of my data, as I extract it from the numerous Google services that I've signed on to, purely out of convenience, over the past 16 years. And importantly, no longer being a product.
