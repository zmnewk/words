I've been a user of my Gmail account, and by extension (& by Google's design) the Google Account Ecosystem since approximately 2007. Very willingly letting them take of the problem of email and other services for the past 16 years for myself and anyone I could reccomend it to (back when people reccomended email providers in casual conversation).
Gmail
Up until very recently I've been comfortable to maintain the statas quo. But now I am strongly considering (and actively investigating) how to exact myself from utilising Google's services. I'd like to share a few reasons *why* here now, and then (hopefully) future posts will cover the *how*.

### Digital Identity and Trust
Digital Identity, A catch-all term for all of your data, accounts and interactions. A driving thought for me was how do I ensure that my digital identify is *flexible*. I want to be able to use the core functions of the internet, without being tethered to a particular enabling corporation. You might ask, why Gmail years then? Trust, I placed my data and maybe more critically, my point of access to my data in a Company that myself, my Dad and my family trusted. Was this misplaced? Perhaps, but in the infantcy of widespread email, Gmail was a pure offering.

[Paul Buchheit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Buchheit), the creator of Gmail, said that "Don't be Evil", the Companies infamous motto was a jab at other companies at the time, who were exploting users. Unfotunately, Google has travelled a long way since then, and nowadays seems more likely to fall in with the crowd that are exploiting, rather than not.

There was no singular moment that broke my trust in Google's system, but I estimate the past few years have been a constant acceleration down the uncertainty slide. And I have been increasingly unceratin about ensuring the flexibity and accesibility of digital identity that is tied up in their ecosystem.

 [killedbygoogle.com](killedbygoogle.com/) is a damming list that demonstrates Google's ruthlesness towards ill-performing products. My personal stand out here was Google Podcasts, an app that I was actively using **the very day** (27/09/2023) they sent me an email announcing they were discontinuing it in favour of Youtube music. 
 
 There are a plethora of other podcast apps out there that I can readily switch to, including that could import my subscriptions. But the level of trust that I had in Google to enable that service for me, definetly took a blow.
 

I don't expect Google to ever sunset gmail, but I do believe that it will continue get worse as a product, as the focus of Google's attention is driven to other sources of revenue. I want my digital identity to be something that I can control, and not be dictated to me by an enabling corporation.

### Luxury Resouces
I once believed that anyone who paid for email was an idiot, a view that I've since rescinded.
In late 2022, Telstra made all payphones across Australia [free to use](https://www.telstra.com.au/exchange/payphones-free-for-calls-australia) for anyone. I can just as easily walk up to a phonebox and make a call, as I can sign up for a gmail account.

Yet I haven't or even seen more than one or two people actually use one.

Why?

The payphones are there, but most people (myself included) pay monthly for a better utility, a mobile phone in our pocket. But I still believe that the payphones should be there for those who need them, like me back in highschool trying to get a hold of Mum.

To not drag the analogy on past its use-by date, I am now in a financial position where I can look to other services that might have a price tag, but provide a much better service that the one's that free from Google.

#Spoilers for the next *How* post to go into more detail about what I've been looking at here, so will finish with this commonly played out quote:

> If you are not paying for it, you're not the customer; you're the product

 First used prior to the internet boom, however I don't thing it really came into form until the targeted advertising ecosystem took over. To me, this **has** to influence the core values that are in forefront of Google's product designers. I am looking forward to exploring the journey of no longer being a product.
